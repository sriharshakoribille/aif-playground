# aif-playground
Playground for implementing different Active Inference agents and comparisons against RL agent baselines.

Depends on my fork for [`pymdp`](https://github.com/sriharshakoribille/pymdp) for Active Inference infrastructure and [`gymnasium`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environments for baselines against RL agents
